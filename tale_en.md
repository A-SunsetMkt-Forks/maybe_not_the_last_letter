A long time ago, the princess of Poplar Kingdom looked at the stars in the sky.

The face of the princess seems to have been carefully carved, more delicate and perfect than any sculpture. Simple and soft lines outline the most beautiful figure in the kingdom. She has thousands of followers from far and near.She lowered her head slightly, as if thinking about something, whispering to her prime minister, "What's the use of stars?"

There are almost no stars hunters in this era. The star-hunting boy steals the light of the stars in the hazy night and lights up the night of Paisen with the gleam of the sky. Alone, he caught the light, everything seemed to be just fun, until one day, he noticed the beautiful woman in Poplar Kingdom.

-----

The star hunter saw what he longed for in the princess.

He tried to communicate with her.

After every night falls, the shining stars are embedded in the dark color like diamonds, waiting and calling. The long night is no longer lonely, and the star hunter presents the most elegant and moving starlight he has caught to the princess. He sealed them in a cute slender bottle, together with his most sincere heart.

-----

Over time, the princess got bored.

She summoned the minister Wan and asked him to deal with the gifts hundreds of millions of light years away."Seriously, what is the use of stars?

"Seriously, what is the use of stars?"

-----

It is said that that night, the forest outside the Kingdom of Poplar was very bright.

-----

The star hunter once again sent a faint blue light, which came from the distant Sirius. The pure blue light reflects all the tranquility and beauty, resonating with the deep sky.

She will like it, she will.

-----

The princess broke the bottle after taking it.

The blue floats in the air, just like the mood of the star hunter.

-----

The star hunter sent letters again and again, and he longed to be forgiven by the princess.

The princess's ministers stopped these letters for her and threw them into the pool of light.

Every attempt by the star hunters to contact has failed.

The star hunting boy can never trade the stars in the sky for a person's heart.

-----

He hides the last star in his pocket.

He hopes, hopes...
